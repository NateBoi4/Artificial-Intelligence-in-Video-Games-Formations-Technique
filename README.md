# Artificial-Intelligence-in-Video-Games-Formations-Technique
A guide for aspiring Video Game AI programmers on the knowledge and development of the formations technique used in coordinated movement for in-game characters.
The code being showcased here reuses a lot of the code base from another project that made use of AI characters. The code was modified for the purposes of demonstrating
the capabilities of scalable formations. Part of the code is my own and part of the code is owned by my Professor at Champlain College, Dean Lawson. 
The code that mainly pertains to the formations is found in the Wander, Heal, and Chase files. These file names are also from the original project.
